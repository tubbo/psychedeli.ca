  We hear a lot of talk by musicians and other "insiders" (who are mostly
  either aficionados or amateur musicians who aren't doing this kind of
  thing full-time. I would be included in this list) about entropy in our
  musical lexicon. We hear talk about DJs not spinning vinyl anymore,
  thereby making DJing even easier than it once was (and more reliable).
  We hear about DJs not constructing their set in the same way as they
  used to, with less variation and care taken to the actual sound levels.
  The fact that there are people who are paid more money in an hour than
  most of us are paid in a day, and they aren't even really making sure
  they don't redline the mixer (which actually can cause damage, I've
  seen it in real life!) or take care to not ruin their fans' ears, is
  both sad and hilarious at the same time. After all, your fans aren't
  going to buy your music anymore if they can't hear it...

Anyway, I'm off track. This post is supposed to be positive, to show
the average [gormandizer][gd] that there isn't some big conspiracy
going on and the electronic music community *needs* people like
Skrillex, Deadmau5, and even Tiesto to further its stranglehold on
our eardrums. Even though these guys might be less skilled than
others who get paid/credited for less, we need them as "evangelists"
of our community. Basically, I'm telling you not to [tell the emperor
that he's not wearing clothes][ehnc].

## musical reaganomics

Reagan proposed the "[trickle-down theory][tdt]" of economics, to the
instantaneous praise of many white-haired, over-privileged WASP-like
creatures in Congress, and the idea came into America's lexicon just
as quickly. While the jury's still out on whether it worked for
America, the trickle-down theory of economics has definitely made
itself known in the music community, as well as most other forms of
mass media. Here's a quick example..

Before Deadmau5 and Skrillex toured the US and spread the "gospel" of
electronic music to middle-america kids, it was really difficult to
get anyone to respond to [The Wonder Bars][bars]' music. Nobody really
knew what to make of it, and it didn't really help that the only places
you could hear it were dirty warehouses or small clubs at the time. I
understand that even before my college years (where I was introduced
to House music and began composing it), it was much more difficult to
find quality house music. But that changed after Deadmau5 played the
Electric Factory in Philly. It took a couple years, but now we're
seeing an absolute explosion in just about everything that has to do
with EDM...

* There have been 3, count 'em!, THREE new venues in the last 2 years
  alone that have produced a purely electronic bill every night they're
  open. This is proof that even in the hardest city to musically make it in
  America, you can *still* turn a profit by booking electronic acts.
* Attendance at PEX parties has increased exponentially every year.
  HeartBurn was cancelled this year for the first time in its history
  because a suitable venue could not be found in time.
* If you have a crew of DJs in Philly and a warehouse you have instant
  success. Period. There's such a small scene here that those of us
  who just love that warehouse vibe are forced to go out and hear music
  like Trap and ratchet-y Dubstep that we may not go out to hear
  on our own. This is actually a really good thing, because it forces
  people out of their comfort zone(s) and into new musical territory,
  which effectively increases our overall comprehension levels for
  different sounds and types of music.

## conclusions

So I like Skrillex. I appreciate Deadmau5, even though I think his music
is boring. I like them because they benefit me, by Skrillex existing
and turning on new audiences to EDM, the "trickle-down" of House-heads
that will inevitably discover the music and be drawn into the love
of House increases. It's a numbers game, and while the probability is
most likely fractions of a percent, multiplying that by 10,000 or even
100,000 people is still a significant fanbase by default. As a concrete
example, take a look at my friends [Cousin Brian][cb], who are playing
shows all the time in other cities like Richmond, Washington DC and
Baltimore, but had trouble finding shows larger than a house basement
in Philly. I think they have a big enough name now that they don't
have this problem as much as when they started, but compare them
with [Jack Deezl][jd] who has literally played the biggest all-ages
electronic venue in Philly, and if I'm not mistaken has been producing
and performing music for a much shorter time frame than Cousin
Brian has. I think this is significant, because even though there was
much less "prep" work that Jack had/has to do to get on stage and
play his tunes, the fan base that Jack was tapping into is by default
larger than the punk community in Philly, and while Cousin Brian is
certainly doing wilder, weirder things with the genre (who the hell
plays punk with 9th chords?? amazing!), Jack is going to have an
easier time promoting himself because a lot of the groundwork
has been done for him by the scene that came before.
