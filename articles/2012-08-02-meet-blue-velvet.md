It's certainly been a while, hasn't it? I've been busy with gigs and
vacation, so there's been little time to blog. I _have_ been working on
stuff...including the foundation of a record label (which I'll talk about
in a future post) and maintaining the Wonder Bars' official website.

In the time it's taken me to maintain that site, I've been quietly
developing a solution to a problem I think most small-scale developers
have, **content duplication**. In other words, we've all run into the
problem of a company's Facebook page saying one thing and their website
another. Who wants to log into 2 different accounts just to paste the
same paragraph of text? Furthermore, what if each CMS has its own input
format...say one lets you do Markdown but the others force you to be
either text-only or HTML-only. Now you're looking at converting content,
and for non-programmers this may just not be a reality, or if it is it's
a nightmare at best.

Something needs to be done. This is the 21st century, after all. With the
power of [Ruby on Rails][ror] and [Rails engines][ren], however, there
_is_ a solution.

## introducing blue_velvet

[blue_velvet][bvg] is a gem I extracted from working code on
[TheWonderBars.com][twb]. The live production codebase uses
the gem with all of its default settings. You probably didn't
notice, which was the whole point. The gem code is an exact
duplicate of the code that previously powered this functionality
on the site, so you're getting what I was working with; a powerful,
convention-over-configuration engine for displaying Facebook attributes
on your own, hosted, well-designed site.

## making it work

Sound fun? It's real easy to get started!

Just add

    gem 'blue_velvet'

to your Gemfile, run

    bundle

and generate the configuration using

    rails g facebook:config

Generate a new Facebook app on <http://developers.facebook.com>. Enter
in your **App ID** and **App Secret** keys to the proper YAML
attributes, then find the Facebook page you want to look for and look
for the number after your page's hyphenated name in the URL. That's your
**page_id**, which you need to put into YAML as well.

Now that you're set up to access a Facebook page, you can build routes
to your Facebook page's attributes like so:

(in `routes.rb`)

    get "/about" => 'facebook/page#description'

Now type `rails server` and visit <http://localhost:3000/about>, and you
should see the content of your page's "Description" field. Since this
was designed to be used in a [PJAX][pj]-style environment, the
attributes are served as partials.

## advanced usage

You can also do some cool stuff on the Ruby side to create better views
of your Facebook content. For example, The Wonder Bars' `/about` page
uses the following Facebook page information to get all of its content
together:

    class FacebookController < Facebook::PageController
      # Accesses 'about', 'description' and 'bio' for a complete "About Us" page.
      def about_us
        @tagline = facebook.about
        @elevator_pitch = facebook.description
        @long_form_bio = facebook.bio
        render layout: false if request.xhr?
      end
    end

You can have any controller access that `facebook` object by simply
inheriting from `Facebook::PageController`. You must cache values from
the Facebook page into instance variables for them to become available
in the view layer. Any attribute that can be obtained via the Page Graph API
can be referenced here in some way. Use the `rails console` to explore
more about the `facebook` object.

As described above, since the default templates use layout-less
partials to serve content, you can create static pages by extending
`Facebook::PageController` and defining custom actions, complete with
static views, to serve static Facebook page content on your hosted site.

## missing something?

Did you expect **blue_velvet** to do something that I missed? If so, let
me know in the [GitHub Issues][bvi] tracker. Or, you can fork the code
and contribute a pull request, I welcome all kinds!
